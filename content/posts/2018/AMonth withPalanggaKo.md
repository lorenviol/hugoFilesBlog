I should have probably have written this sooner, but with life and work, here I am doing it now.
More than a month has already passed from the incredible travel I had in the Philippines, and I canâ€™t stop telling you how much I would love to go back, especially with this crazy, freezing, rainy, depressing London weather.
Itâ€™s been twenty eight memorable days of incredible experiences, not just like been traveling, but being completely immersed into the Filipino culture.

But I think I need to flashback you on this story for a second, or a paragraph ðŸ˜‰.

Two years ago, like currently, I was really into the Instagram game, and sometimes I casually spammed likes across strategically chosen hashtags in order to gain some likes and followers back. As I was using Filmborn as one of my main editing apps on my iPhone, Iâ€™ve been looking through this tag as well to see what creators using the same editing software were sharing; and one of this photos that I hearted changed my life in a way I would never have imagined.
By liking this picture I met the best person I will ever know, and eventually, fell in love with him.
And to think that it all started by a like of a random tag on a random photo sharing platform, itâ€™s something quite incredible, or as someone would say: destiny.
So we started exchanging messages, and video calls for then not being able to think a life without us, so we fell in love.
But it was all on the internet, in this gigantic imaginary cloud that connects us to this huge home weâ€™re living called Earth, in such wise it was only logical to take a step forward.
Therefor we planned our first meet in person with a travel around Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand; but for some diabolical black forces beyond our control, our plan we had been dying to do miserably failed, but we didnâ€™t give up, in fact our love grew stronger than ever.
After two years weâ€™ve been able to remake our plan, and this time we made it!
We finally met!
Traveling together in one of the best countries Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to visit: the Philippines.

I donâ€™t even know where to start to share the many beautiful memorable moments we had. Iâ€™ve been meeting the love of my life, his family, his gorgeous Avalon, Iâ€™m so grateful and blessed for all it.
What I only wish now is for time to go faster, faster than ever until the day we are meeting again.
