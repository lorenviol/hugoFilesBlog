It’s been a while since I got the iPhone 6S Plus now, and one of the greatest features that Apple highlighted a lot of this new model was certainly Live Photos.
I had lots of fun capturing pictures with that new thing: told people were selfies, for then show them the video behind it, so hilarious!
But nothing more than that, well, up to few days ago …

The reason why I love photography so much, is because lets tell me people’s stories in a way that is so true and realistic, it captures the essence of a moment.
When I first saw this Live Photos feature I quickly thought: “What are you doing Apple … Assembling a photo with a three seconds video? That doesn’t sound revolutionary!”, and is not, is just a very simple thing that no one else’s thought to implement before (well, except J. K. Rowling in Harry Potter), that just works!

And that gave me an idea …

As I wrote you in the previous post, in December I’ve been traveling to London, and every day I captured some Live Photos around, like that, to create memories of this wonderful trip.

I’ve captured so many of these, that I decided to make a video about it.

Sit down, relax, and enjoy these three minutes of Live Memories from London:
