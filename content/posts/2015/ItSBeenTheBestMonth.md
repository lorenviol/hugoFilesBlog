Hey there, Iâ€™m writing you back from my old comfy workstation, howâ€™s going?

For me not bad, thanks for asking ðŸ˜Š. 

Well, in these September days I felt a little bit of and sadness and depression, but just because I had the best time the previous month and Iâ€™m already missing it, but Iâ€™m here today to tell you all about it.

The main reason why August rocked, itâ€™s because I basically been traveling for the whole month, and you know that I love travels.

You probably already know that, but Iâ€™ve been: visiting amazing places such as the most wild and natural island of Italy (the Asinara), hiking hills and mountains in both Scotland and Italy, and walking on my favorite Latiumâ€™s lake for about a week.

The most amazing part was of course the end of the month, where I had an amazing trip to Edinburgh and met my friend ðŸ˜ƒ!

Edinburgh itâ€™s such a great city, nothing to do with Glasgow where I was a couple of years ago for the pipe band championship, so glad I visited it! 

One day when I was hiking the Arthurâ€™s seat in Holyrood park, it didnâ€™t even seemed to be in a city, but in the middle of nowhere with a stunning and breathtaking view of Edinburgh. 

And because I was there for the end of the festival that happens every year in August, Iâ€™ve been even able to see some cool street performances.

Thereâ€™re lots of stories that Iâ€™d like to tell you about it, and even more adventures about to come, where Iâ€™ll (maybe) finally start the occasional vlog thing â€¦ 
As always, stay tuned ðŸ˜‰
