On Sunday May 17th my sister and I did the first Roma photo marathon, was a pretty great experience.

Is basically a contest to win photographic material, travels and more.
We spent 9 hours (or actually more), trying to capture as much great photos as possible for 9 different themes that were addressed to the partecipants.
That day, my camera of choice was the Nikon D5200 with the basic Nikkor 18-105mm lens, I captured a lot of photos, 236 24mpx RAW files for being specific, and I spent the whole Monday to select and send just 9 of these.

You can the captures that I sent down below, and shoutout to [my sisterâ€™s ones as well (link)](https://href.li/?http://roma.italiaphotomarathon.it/?view=partecipante&id=533).
