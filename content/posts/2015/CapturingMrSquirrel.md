It’s Thursday and it’s time for another Throwback!

I remember that day like yesterday, (exactly three years ago) I were in London with my family for a little trip, and after visiting Buckingham Palace we went to St. James park where I luclky found a squirrel posing for me!

And this was the final capture:
