Yesterday I went to a beach near Rome, in Fregene with my family, the weather was amazing but still a bit chill for wearing t-shirts and flip-flops.

Going there reminded me how cool is exploring sea places by spring, you’ll find an anusual emptiness that is very hard or impossible to spot by the summer season.

As a photographer, I quiet enjoyed this peaceful atmosphere.
