Another throwback today …

Here I was in Fregenae, a little seaside city nearby Rome, and I can remember that I had such a lovely evening out with my family, wish the weather could be as warm as it was, and days as long as it were ..

But hey it’s winter, so what could I expect, is also conforting feeling cold temperatures outside, otherwise we would’ve a way bigger problem about climate change that we’re having right now (still big though), plus the Christmas season is already there!
Are you as excited as me for XMas this year?
I honestly can’t wait to visit again London and hanging out with my sister, and who knows what 2016 will be like …
Stick with me, more adventures are about to come …
