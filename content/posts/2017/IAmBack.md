In those past two months I’ve been traveling throuought south-east Asia/Oceania discovering incredible new places, meeting amazing new people and capturing what I never thought I would.

I have a tons of different stories to tell, the problem is now sorting my thoughts out and putting it on paper (it might take a while).

I’m gonna do that real soon, or at least try …

Keen to be back and can’t wait what this year will lead me to, is just getting started, and so far it’s been like a dream … 
Don’t punch me please, ‘cause if it’s really what I think is, I don’t wanna wake up.

Soon,
with love,
your internet blogger: Lorenzo.
