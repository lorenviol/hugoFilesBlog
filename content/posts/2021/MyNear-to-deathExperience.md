Iâ€™ve had many in my quarter of century life, but the most recent happened just few days ago, when I was trying to fix a stupid kitchen knife with super glue, typical Lorenzo ðŸ¤ª.

I wouldnâ€™t call it a near-to-death experience, something more like a near-to-loose-vision experience, but definitely an event that caused a mental shock even after everything was calmed down.

Is one of those circumstances in life that when they reveal themselves they make your mind go on a crazy what-if mental contorted journey causing a stand still. Thatâ€™s excactly how I reacted, I couldnâ€™t help but fall into that vicious path. Thankfully, it all faded away with a bit of time, trying to focus my thoughts on how grateful I were to be still alive, or at least you know, have vision.

So, the lid of the tube was stuck because I didnâ€™t clean it before closing it, and by trying to open it, the tube broke with an handful of glue spreading right on my right eye and when I noticed it was too late. Iâ€™m glad that I was wearing glasses, if I didnâ€™t I have no idea what would have happened. Would have I still be able to open the eyelid, or to have vision? Would have I rushed to the ER? If that so how much would have been the expense here in the Philippines .. 

Thankfully none of that happened, Iâ€™m still happily alive and able to see on both eyes, but next time I will surely throw that tube away ðŸ˜†.

What about you, have you ever had any near-to-death experiences, if so feel free to share it in the comments below.

Until next time, 

your blogger,

Lorenzo.
