This web site respects your privacy. It only utilizes the absolute minimum of information, provided by third-party services, that is necessary to operate in an efficient and aesthetically coherent manner. There is no business model associated with this site, there is nothing sold here and there is no mailing list.

### Site Architecture and third-party services used:

This is a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generated using the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io) and hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) on [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/lorenviol/lorenviol.github.io). Additional technologies used on top of that include:

**[Google Analytics (GA)](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245)**. GA is used to track the number of visitors to this site. This is done for me to improve the site and thus improve your experience.

>You can opt out of GA by installing the [GA opt-out browser add-on](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en).

**[Google Fonts (GF)](https://developers.google.com/fonts/)**. GF are high-quality fonts used on this web site, to improve the quality of the final rendered text at your end. This is an essential service for the appearance of the site.<br>For privacy considerations concerning the use of GF you can read [here](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#what_does_using_the_google_fonts_api_mean_for_the_privacy_of_my_users).

**[Telegram Comments](https://comments.app)**. A Telegram plug-in is enabled on this site to allow user comments in the siteâ€™s articles via the [DiscussBot](https://t.me/discussbot). All the data flowing through the plug-in (comments and registered users) are controlled by Telegram.

>If you are concerned about privacy regarding Telegram you can read [here](https://telegram.org/privacy) and for the DiscussBot [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#what-messages-will-my-bot-get).
